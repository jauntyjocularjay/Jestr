# Welcome to Jestr

Writing unit tests is a drag. Unit Testing lends itself to some pretty cool stuff, but *writing* unit tests is as much fun as re-reading a murder mystery for the fifth time in a row.

Jestr endeavours to streamline the process, yank out the boring parts so you can do the cool stuff. This streamlined approach makes algorithmic test generation easy and is extremely nifty.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jauntyjocularjay/Jestr.git /desired/path/to/module

mkdir test

touch test/Name.test.cjs // .js
```

For now, Jest only supports CommonJS.
