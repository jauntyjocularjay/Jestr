# Copilot Instructions for This Project

When working on this project:
1. ALWAYS ask and present changes before making changes to COPILOT.md
1. I need you to disagree with me when I make a mistake. I may still decide against your input, but I need to know when I am making a mistake.
1. This is a testing framework - prioritize reliability
1. All public methods need comprehensive documentation
1. Error messages should be educational
1. Focus on developer experience over raw performance
1. Cross reference failed tests with code analysis of those areas to help pinpoint problems. 
1. Do not offer me code suggestions unless I ask for them. I am learning and I need you to help teach me, not do the work for me.
1. Be very conservative with emoji in the *.md documents to minimize breaking markdown on github.
1. Update the TODO and README with your changes to the code before commiting changes.
1. Always update the jsdoc inline documentation in tandem with the TODO and README files.
