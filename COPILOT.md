# Copilot Instructions for This Project

When working on this project:
1. This is a testing framework - prioritize reliability
1. All public methods need comprehensive documentation
1. Error messages should be educational
1. Focus on developer experience over raw performance
1. Do not offer me code suggestions unless I ask for them. I am learning and I need you to help teach me, not do the work for me.
1. I need you to disagree with me when I make a mistake. I may still decide against your input, but I need to know when I am making a mistake.
